# DeepBone: Predictive Bone Age Assessment through Image Processing and Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for bone age assessment using image processing techniques and deep learning. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle containing hand X-ray images along with their corresponding bone age labels.
